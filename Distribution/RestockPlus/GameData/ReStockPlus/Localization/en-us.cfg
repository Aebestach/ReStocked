    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-corgi_title = KR-10A 'Corgi' Liquid Fuel Engine Cluster
    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-corgi_description = Kerbodyne engineers have discovered that clustering can be an effective solution when you need more thrust, and don't want to add more boosters. This upper stage engine is very efficient as it takes advantage of a set of lovingly handcrafted, free range KR-10 Engines.

    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-boar_title = KR-1 'Boar' Liquid Fuel Engine
    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-boar_description = The single Boar is slightly more efficient than its dual counterpart, and provides, logically, half the thrust. Due to a less integrated set of mounting points, there is a slight decrease in raw thrust-to-weight ratio.
