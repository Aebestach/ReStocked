    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-corgi_title = KR-10A 'Corgi' Liquid Fuel Engine Cluster
    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-corgi_description = Kerbodyne engineers have discovered that clustering can be an effective solution when you need more thrust, and don't want to add more boosters. This upper stage engine is very efficient as it takes advantage of a set of lovingly handcrafted, free range KR-10 Engines.

    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-boar_title = KR-1 'Boar' Liquid Fuel Engine
    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-engine-boar_description = The single Boar is slightly more efficient than its dual counterpart, and provides, logically, half the thrust. Due to a less integrated set of mounting points, there is a slight decrease in raw thrust-to-weight ratio.

    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-drone-core-375-1_description = The massive XL RGU system designed by Kerbodyne and built by STEADLER is a triumph of aerospace engineering and contains important features such as the large empty void in the centre, which can be filled with anything you like. Unlike other stack RGUs, it contains powerful reaction wheels so doubles as a guidance unit.

    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-docking-375-1_description = When the thrill of docking enormous objects in space disappears, one must logically proceed to humongous objects. This even larger docking port is the result of 6 months of R&D to define the precise meaning of the word 'humongous'.

    #LOC_RestockPlus_restock-fairing-base-0625-1_description = While the Kerbals at Mission Control were still figuring out how to get their rockets back down to Kerbin safely, the research engineers at FLOOYD were quickly realising that protecting parts on ascent was just as important. Heavy research into two-dimensional-input driven procedural construction was then funded with the hopes of making protective shells for important payloads and interstage areas of the crafts. The protective shells also have the benefit of making the craft more aerodynamic, hopefully saving on precious rocket fuel! The AE-FF0 is an even tinier size available from FLOOYD.
